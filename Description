✅ Project: DC Motor Speed Controller using PWM
📍 Platform: Tinkercad (Simulation Only)

In this project, I built a speed control system for a DC motor using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) from an Arduino. A potentiometer is used to vary the speed in real-time. The PWM signal drives a transistor, which controls the power to the motor. A flyback diode ensures protection from voltage spikes.

This project helped me understand:

Analog to PWM signal conversion

Motor control using transistors

Circuit protection techniques

Real-time speed control systems


📚 Applications: EVs, smart appliances, industrial automation

🛠️ Simulated with: Arduino UNO, TIP120 transistor, potentiometer, flyback diode
